<p>I believe that all intellectual and creative work should be published under open access principles, and so I have included PDFs of my MA theses here. Writing grant applications is a part of graduate school's hidden curriculum that can be confusing to navigate without institutional support and has a big impact on student success. One of the things that has helped me the most with writing grant applications is reading the successful applications of students who applied to the grants before me, so I have shared here some of my own successful grant applications.</p>
