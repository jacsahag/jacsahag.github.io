    <p>I am a PhD candidate, writer, and life-long punk who splits my time between Appalachia and metro-Detroit. I am inspired by the sounds, landscape, buildings, history, and people of Detroit, and other wild, weird, wonderful places. My intellectual and artistic pursuits are grounded in Robin Kelley's assertion that “the imagination [is] our most powerful weapon.” </p>
    
    <p>My academic interests intersect urban history, popular music studies, cultural history, Black diaspora history, and digital and public humanities. I am broadly interested in how creative practice, especially music, can be radicalizing and how space/place informs art-making. I am currently working on a dissertation about underground music scenes and radical politics in Detroit to tell the story of the diverse group of punks, techno futurists, and anarchists that leveraged the absences of capital and the state in the wake of the 1967 Rebellion to create radical alternatives to the status quo and redefine the postindustrial city. Through their musical production and self-published zines, these activists, artists, and musicians were intellectuals working out how to achieve a more dignified life in the city amidst urban crisis.</p>
    
    <p>My archival research relies heavily on zines accessed in the private collections of scene participants that are not housed in “official” archives. I am at work building a digital archive that will make these publications more accessible to a broader audience of future utopian dreamers and radical historians. My obsession with zines has spilled over into pedagogy and <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/workshop-zine-translation/">I designed a workshop</a> for using zines to teach digital humanities methods. If you or someone you know has a Detroit-related zine collection, please contact me!</p>

    <p>I have an M.A. in Southern Studies from the University of Mississippi, where I lived for three years studying place, the South, and the blues. My thesis on the Oxford, MS-based Fat Possum records, which situated the record label's marketing practices in a lineage of tactics used to sell blues to white audiences throughout the twentieth century, won the department's top prize. While I lived in Oxford, I also wrote for Living Blues magazine and bussed tables at a soul food restaurant. I miss Mississippi most days. </p>

    <p>My family has been rooted in and around Detroit for generations. My great-grandparents on my father's side arrived there after fleeing the Armenian genocide. My grandfather on my mother's side worked at the iconic advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, writing ads for Chrysler.  </p>
