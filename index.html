    <p>I study the cultural history of the 20th century United States, with interests in popular music studies, Black studies, and digital and public history. I am broadly interested in how creative practice, especially musicking, can be radicalizing and how space/place informs art-making. I have interned with the Encyclopedia of Virginia and am currently a Praxis fellow in digital humanities with the UVA Library Scholars' Lab.</p>
    
    <p>My dissertation, “Anarchy in Detroit: Reimagining the Postindustrial City, 1967-2013” intersects urban history, cultural history, social movement history, and popular music studies to tell the story of the diverse group of punks, techno futurists, and anarchists that leveraged the absences of capital and the state in Detroit in the wake of the 1967 Rebellion to create radical alternatives to the status quo and redefine the postindustrial city. Through their musical production and self-published zines, these activists, artists, and musicians acted as underground intellectuals working out how to achieve a more dignified life in the city amidst urban crisis.</p>
    
    <p>My archival research relies heavily on zines accessed in the private collections of scene participants that are not housed in “official” archives. I am at work building a digital archive that will make these publications more accessible to a broader audience of future utopian dreamers and radical historians. My obsession with zines has spilled over into pedagogy and I designed a workshop for using zines to teach digital humanities methods. If you or someone you know has a Detroit-related zine collection, please contact me.</p>
    
    <p>My family has been rooted in and around Detroit for multiple generations. My great-grandparents on my father's side arrived in Detroit after fleeing the Armenian genocide. My grandfather on my mother's side worked at the iconic advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, writing ads for Chrysler.  </p>

    <p>Like many Detroiters before me, I am a proud, active union member. United Campus Workers is organizing public universities in right-to-work states in the South and across the country.</p>
