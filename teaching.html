<p>As part of the 2021-2022 Praxis Program cohort in the UVa Library Scholars' Lab, I collaborated with an amazing and inspiring group of fellows as well as Slab staff to create an OER that guides graduate students through creating their own personal website. I used this project to help me make this site.</p>

<p>My archival research relies heavily on zines accessed in the private collections of scene participants that are not housed in “official” archives. I am at work building a digital archive that will make these publications more accessible to a broader audience of future utopian dreamers and radical historians. My obsession with zines has spilled over into pedagogy and <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/workshop-zine-translation/">I designed a workshop</a> for using zines to teach digital humanities methods. If you or someone you know has a Detroit-related zine collection, please contact me!</p>
