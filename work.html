<p>Outside my academic work, I have over a decade of varied professional writing and nonprofit experience. I have written successful grant applications, published blog posts, feature stories, news stories, music reviews, magazine articles, encyclopedia entries, academic theses, poetry and short stories. I am passionate about the role of arts and culture in creating a more socially just and liberated society, and have worked in social and racial justice advocacy efforts with the community-based music archive Detroit Sound Conservancy, the labor union United Campus Workers Virginia where I served as chair of the Welcoming Committee, in the classroom through teaching courses including the History of Whiteness and Intro to African and African American Studies, and as a volunteer docent at a historic Black church that was converted into a local African American history museum in Oxford, MS.</p> 
    
<p>In addition to writing, teaching, and research, I have training in project management, web design, oral history, and event planning and implementation.</p>
